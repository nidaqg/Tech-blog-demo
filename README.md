## Usage

When a user navigates to the blog, they will be presented with a homepage with all blogposts along with each post's author and date of creation. No other page will be able to be accessed without being logged in and clicking on any of the blogposts will automatically direct the user to the login/signup page. The login page can also be reached from the link in the navbar. Once the user is logged in, they will be able to see a link to their dashboard + a logout button in the navbar. Now the user can click on any of the blogposts from the home page and they will be taken to the blog post page which will display the entire post, all comments on that blog as well as a field to leave a new comment. 
If the user navigates to their dashboard, they will see al the blogposts they have written, an option to edit or delete each of the posts as well as the option to add a new blogpost. If new blogpost is added, it will be displayed on the user's dashboard.
If the user is inactive for more then 1 minute they will automatically be logged out of the website and need to log in again to access it.
